## About This Project

The Gender-Inclusive Spanish Digital Archive was constructed by [Euge Stumm](https://eugestumm.github.io/) and [Ben Papadopoulos](https://www.benpapadopoulos.com/). The first version of this project featured the <a href="https://sections.lasaweb.org/sections/sexualities-studies/show.php?type=news&id=692&pg=2">Workshop on Alliances: Gender-Inclusive Language, History, and the Struggle against Colonialism</a> at the [Sexuality Studies](https://sections.lasaweb.org/sections/sexualities-studies) section of the [Latin American Studies Association](https://lasaweb.org/en). This [Digital Humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) project provides participants with interactive temporal and spatial visualizations of Spanish-speaking cultural productions featuring gender-inclusive forms, as well as its theoretical underpinnings centered around colonialism and related forms of oppression, ranging from colonial to contemporary times. Our primary resources include colonial language documents, art, zines, poetry, theses, manifestos, short stories, novels, and videos. You may view the Archive [spatially](https://eugestumm.github.io/gender-inclusive-spanish-digital-archive/map.html) or [temporally](https://eugestumm.github.io/gender-inclusive-spanish-digital-archive/timeline.html) and a full list of the data with descriptions may be located [here](https://eugestumm.github.io/gender-inclusive-spanish-digital-archive/data.html).


## About The Authors

<a href="https://eugestumm.github.io/">Euge Stumm</a> (they/them/elle/elu) is a Dean's Fellow and Ph.D. student in Literary, Cultural, and Linguistic Studies in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at the University of Miami. Their research examines how gender and sexual dissidents in Latin America construct language to express their experiences. Their research corpus focuses on cultural productions utilizing inclusive language and non-binary Spanish in Argentina, and Pajubá, a cryptolect originally developed by travesti sex workers, in Brazil. Currently, they are developing an open-access Pajubá Digital Archive, gathering multiple resources, dictionaries, and scholarly works on the cryptolect.

[Ben Papadopoulos](https://www.benpapadopoulos.com/) (he/they/él/elle) is a recent Ph.D graduate in Hispanic Languages and Literatures from the University of California, Berkeley. He is primarily interested in the fields of sociolinguistics and critical sociology. His research revolves around the topic of gender-inclusive language and makes sociological arguments about language as a category of power and the right of queer and trans people to have and use adequate forms of self-identification. Relatedly, he is the founder of the <a href="https://www.genderinlanguage.com/">Gender in Language Project</a>, which aims to offer grammars of gender in as many languages as possible.
